This is sample project. 
I'm practising my html and css whilst learning how to work with git. 
Oh and I'm using the Vim editor from the linux terminal, which is also kinda new to me,to edit this file. 
I'm learning a lot these days. :)

This is the code for general assembly dash's project 4. I have not started the project yet. I'm just attempting to do it on my own by looking at the robot's picture before starting the project.

ok, I'm done editing the file. add the file to staging, commit and push. got it.
